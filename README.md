# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
Collection of notes, problem sets and projects for Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

## Week 0
* A BYTE is 8 BITS
* ASCII is a standard mapping system, which dictates how numbers match to letters -> uses ONE BYTE
* UNICODE is a standard that allows characters/emojis etc to be represented as characters with MULTIPLE BYTES

### Abstraction
* ABSTRACTION is a concept in computer science where some low-level implementation (e.g. how data is ultimately stored in binary) is simplified or taken for granted
    * This allows us to use that implementation at a higher level (e.g. representing letters, that we can then use in our programs)
    * When we receive an emoji, computer is actually just receiving a decimel number - which maps to the image of the emoji
* Computers also use binary to represent images -> RGB
    * Within 3 bytes, each representing some amount of red, green and blue, we can represent millions of colours

### Algorithms
* ALGORITHMS are step-by-step instrutions for solving a problem
